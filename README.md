OpenAPI consists of moomoo OpenD and moomoo API:

moomoo OpenD is the gateway program of moomoo API, running on your local computer or cloud server. It is responsible for transferring the protocol requests to moomoo servers, and returning the processed data.
moomoo API is an API SDK encapsulated by moomoo, including mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript), to reduce the difficulty of your trading strategy development. If the language you want to use is not listed above, you can still interface with the protocol yourself to complete the trading strategy development.
Diagrams below illustrate the architecture of OpenAPI.
